## Introduction
[Cartola F.C.](cartolafc.globo.com "Open Cartola F.C.") is a fantasy soccer game by Globo Group. It is tied to the male Brazilian Soccer Championship - A league. <br/>
For the 2020-2021 season of the championship, my friends and me have created "Quem Cair Calil", a league inside Cartola.<br/>
Our league is made up of 4 (four) "serious" teams (_Unichampions, Vanculotte Atiantino, Gigante de JF, Caio do Céu_), and 3 (three) "non-serious" (_Ibobesta Líbero, Do Pescoço pra Baixo é Canela EC, Janderson maisdez_). The serious teams compete to see who scores more points until the end of the Brazilian Championship (38th round). On the other hand, the non-serious teams compete to see who scores less points until the end.
## Data
All the data for this project is inside the [data](https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/estatisticas-quem-cair-calil/tree/main/data "Open this folder") folder.<br/>
To keep everything organized there are 2 (two) datasets: the information about the course of the league in a csv file, and the information about each team's escalation for each of the rounds in another file.

## Notebooks
In this [folder](https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/estatisticas-quem-cair-calil/tree/main/notebooks "Go to the notebooks folder") there are 2 (two) separate notebooks: one for each dataset. Inside them you'll find data-analyses and simple graph plots, so that everyone participating in the league understands my discoveries, even those who have never seen a line of code before.
